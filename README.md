## Write a brief `reflection` on what you learned from this tutorial here:

React can only pass down so you have to be careful about where information starts and where you need it. React is incredible object oriented, which can be both messy and incredibly streamlined so long as you are careful to track your variables and not add unnecessary states.

Also, note to self: don't change state in render. It will get called too many times and crash the app. Ensure it is in a separate function or there is a condition to endsure it is only set once.
